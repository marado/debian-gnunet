6.32 GNU Name System (GNS)
==========================

The GNU Name System (GNS) is a decentralized database that enables users
to securely resolve names to values.  Names can be used to identify
other users (for example, in social networking), or network services
(for example, VPN services running at a peer in GNUnet, or purely
IP-based services on the Internet).  Users interact with GNS by typing
in a hostname that ends in a top-level domain that is configured in the
“GNS” section, matches an identity of the user or ends in a
Base32-encoded public key.

   Videos giving an overview of most of the GNS and the motivations
behind it is available here and here.  The remainder of this chapter
targets developers that are familiar with high level concepts of GNS as
presented in these talks.

   GNS-aware applications should use the GNS resolver to obtain the
respective records that are stored under that name in GNS. Each record
consists of a type, value, expiration time and flags.

   The type specifies the format of the value.  Types below 65536
correspond to DNS record types, larger values are used for GNS-specific
records.  Applications can define new GNS record types by reserving a
number and implementing a plugin (which mostly needs to convert the
binary value representation to a human-readable text format and
vice-versa).  The expiration time specifies how long the record is to be
valid.  The GNS API ensures that applications are only given non-expired
values.  The flags are typically irrelevant for applications, as GNS
uses them internally to control visibility and validity of records.

   Records are stored along with a signature.  The signature is
generated using the private key of the authoritative zone.  This allows
any GNS resolver to verify the correctness of a name-value mapping.

   Internally, GNS uses the NAMECACHE to cache information obtained from
other users, the NAMESTORE to store information specific to the local
users, and the DHT to exchange data between users.  A plugin API is used
to enable applications to define new GNS record types.

6.32.1 libgnunetgns
-------------------

The GNS API itself is extremely simple.  Clients first connec to the GNS
service using ‘GNUNET_GNS_connect’.  They can then perform lookups using
‘GNUNET_GNS_lookup’ or cancel pending lookups using
‘GNUNET_GNS_lookup_cancel’.  Once finished, clients disconnect using
‘GNUNET_GNS_disconnect’.

File: gnunet.info,  Node: Looking up records,  Next: Accessing the records,  Up: libgnunetgns

6.32.1.1 Looking up records
...........................

‘GNUNET_GNS_lookup’ takes a number of arguments:

handle This is simply the GNS connection handle from
     ‘GNUNET_GNS_connect’.
name The client needs to specify the name to
     be resolved.  This can be any valid DNS or GNS hostname.
zone The client
     needs to specify the public key of the GNS zone against which the
     resolution should be done.  Note that a key must be provided, the
     client should look up plausible values using its configuration, the
     identity service and by attempting to interpret the TLD as a
     base32-encoded public key.
type This is the desired GNS or DNS record type
     to look for.  While all records for the given name will be
     returned, this can be important if the client wants to resolve
     record types that themselves delegate resolution, such as CNAME,
     PKEY or GNS2DNS. Resolving a record of any of these types will only
     work if the respective record type is specified in the request, as
     the GNS resolver will otherwise follow the delegation and return
     the records from the respective destination, instead of the
     delegating record.
only_cached This argument should typically be set to
     ‘GNUNET_NO’.  Setting it to ‘GNUNET_YES’ disables resolution via
     the overlay network.
shorten_zone_key If GNS encounters new names during resolution,
     their respective zones can automatically be learned and added to
     the "shorten zone".  If this is desired, clients must pass the
     private key of the shorten zone.  If NULL is passed, shortening is
     disabled.
proc This argument identifies
     the function to call with the result.  It is given proc_cls, the
     number of records found (possilby zero) and the array of the
     records as arguments.  proc will only be called once.  After proc,>
     has been called, the lookup must no longer be cancelled.
proc_cls The closure for proc.

6.32.1.2 Accessing the records
..............................

The ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ library provides an API to manipulate the GNS
record array that is given to proc.  In particular, it offers functions
such as converting record values to human-readable strings (and back).
However, most ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ functions are not interesting to GNS
client applications.

   For DNS records, the ‘libgnunetdnsparser’ library provides functions
for parsing (and serializing) common types of DNS records.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Creating records,  Next: Future work,  Prev: Accessing the records,  Up: libgnunetgns

6.32.1.3 Creating records
.........................

Creating GNS records is typically done by building the respective record
information (possibly with the help of ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ and
‘libgnunetdnsparser’) and then using the ‘libgnunetnamestore’ to publish
the information.  The GNS API is not involved in this operation.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Future work,  Prev: Creating records,  Up: libgnunetgns

6.32.1.4 Future work
....................

In the future, we want to expand ‘libgnunetgns’ to allow applications to
observe shortening operations performed during GNS resolution, for
example so that users can receive visual feedback when this happens.

6.32.2 libgnunetgnsrecord
-------------------------

The ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ library is used to manipulate GNS records (in
plaintext or in their encrypted format).  Applications mostly interact
with ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ by using the functions to convert GNS record
values to strings or vice-versa, or to lookup a GNS record type number
by name (or vice-versa).  The library also provides various other
functions that are mostly used internally within GNS, such as converting
keys to names, checking for expiration, encrypting GNS records to GNS
blocks, verifying GNS block signatures and decrypting GNS records from
GNS blocks.

   We will now discuss the four commonly used functions of the
API. ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ does not perform these operations itself, but
instead uses plugins to perform the operation.  GNUnet includes plugins
to support common DNS record types as well as standard GNS record types.

File: gnunet.info,  Node: Value handling,  Next: Type handling,  Up: libgnunetgnsrecord

6.32.2.1 Value handling
.......................

‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_value_to_string’ can be used to convert the (binary)
representation of a GNS record value to a human readable, 0-terminated
UTF-8 string.  NULL is returned if the specified record type is not
supported by any available plugin.

   ‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_string_to_value’ can be used to try to convert a
human readable string to the respective (binary) representation of a GNS
record value.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Type handling,  Prev: Value handling,  Up: libgnunetgnsrecord

6.32.2.2 Type handling
......................

‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_typename_to_number’ can be used to obtain the numeric
value associated with a given typename.  For example, given the typename
"A" (for DNS A reocrds), the function will return the number 1.  A list
of common DNS record types is here
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types).  Note that not
all DNS record types are supported by GNUnet GNSRECORD plugins at this
time.

   ‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_number_to_typename’ can be used to obtain the
typename associated with a given numeric value.  For example, given the
type number 1, the function will return the typename "A".


File: gnunet.info,  Node: GNS plugins,  Next: The GNS Client-Service Protocol,  Prev: libgnunetgnsrecord,  Up: GNU Name System (GNS)

6.32.3 GNS plugins
------------------

Adding a new GNS record type typically involves writing (or extending) a
GNSRECORD plugin.  The plugin needs to implement the
‘gnunet_gnsrecord_plugin.h’ API which provides basic functions that are
needed by GNSRECORD to convert typenames and values of the respective
record type to strings (and back).  These gnsrecord plugins are
typically implemented within their respective subsystems.  Examples for
such plugins can be found in the GNSRECORD, GNS and CONVERSATION
subsystems.

   The ‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ library is then used to locate, load and
query the appropriate gnsrecord plugin.  Which plugin is appropriate is
determined by the record type (which is just a 32-bit integer).  The
‘libgnunetgnsrecord’ library loads all block plugins that are installed
at the local peer and forwards the application request to the plugins.
If the record type is not supported by the plugin, it should simply
return an error code.

   The central functions of the block APIs (plugin and main library) are
the same four functions for converting between values and strings, and
typenames and numbers documented in the previous subsection.

6.32.4 The GNS Client-Service Protocol
--------------------------------------

The GNS client-service protocol consists of two simple messages, the
‘LOOKUP’ message and the ‘LOOKUP_RESULT’.  Each ‘LOOKUP’ message
contains a unique 32-bit identifier, which will be included in the
corresponding response.  Thus, clients can send many lookup requests in
parallel and receive responses out-of-order.  A ‘LOOKUP’ request also
includes the public key of the GNS zone, the desired record type and
fields specifying whether shortening is enabled or networking is
disabled.  Finally, the ‘LOOKUP’ message includes the name to be
resolved.

   The response includes the number of records and the records
themselves in the format created by
‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_records_serialize’.  They can thus be deserialized
using ‘GNUNET_GNSRECORD_records_deserialize’.

6.32.5 Hijacking the DNS-Traffic using gnunet-service-dns
---------------------------------------------------------

This section documents how the gnunet-service-dns (and the
gnunet-helper-dns) intercepts DNS queries from the local system.  This
is merely one method for how we can obtain GNS queries.  It is also
possible to change ‘resolv.conf’ to point to a machine running
‘gnunet-dns2gns’ or to modify libc’s name system switch (NSS)
configuration to include a GNS resolution plugin.  The method described
in this chaper is more of a last-ditch catch-all approach.

   ‘gnunet-service-dns’ enables intercepting DNS traffic using policy
based routing.  We MARK every outgoing DNS-packet if it was not sent by
our application.  Using a second routing table in the Linux kernel these
marked packets are then routed through our virtual network interface and
can thus be captured unchanged.

   Our application then reads the query and decides how to handle it.
If the query can be addressed via GNS, it is passed to
‘gnunet-service-gns’ and resolved internally using GNS. In the future, a
reverse query for an address of the configured virtual network could be
answered with records kept about previous forward queries.  Queries that
are not hijacked by some application using the DNS service will be sent
to the original recipient.  The answer to the query will always be sent
back through the virtual interface with the original nameserver as
source address.

File: gnunet.info,  Node: Network Setup Details,  Up: Hijacking the DNS-Traffic using gnunet-service-dns

6.32.5.1 Network Setup Details
..............................

The DNS interceptor adds the following rules to the Linux kernel:
     iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT 1 -p udp --sport $LOCALPORT --dport 53 \
     -j ACCEPT iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT 2 -p udp --dport 53 -j MARK \
     --set-mark 3 ip rule add fwmark 3 table2 ip route add default via \
     $VIRTUALDNS table2

   Line 1 makes sure that all packets coming from a port our application
opened beforehand (‘$LOCALPORT’) will be routed normally.  Line 2 marks
every other packet to a DNS-Server with mark 3 (chosen arbitrarily).
The third line adds a routing policy based on this mark 3 via the
routing table.

6.32.6 Serving DNS lookups via GNS on W32
-----------------------------------------

This section documents how the libw32nsp (and
gnunet-gns-helper-service-w32) do DNS resolutions of DNS queries on the
local system.  This only applies to GNUnet running on W32.

   W32 has a concept of "Namespaces" and "Namespace providers".  These
are used to present various name systems to applications in a generic
way.  Namespaces include DNS, mDNS, NLA and others.  For each namespace
any number of providers could be registered, and they are queried in an
order of priority (which is adjustable).

   Applications can resolve names by using WSALookupService*() family of
functions.

   However, these are WSA-only facilities.  Common BSD socket functions
for namespace resolutions are gethostbyname and getaddrinfo (among
others).  These functions are implemented internally (by default - by
mswsock, which also implements the default DNS provider) as wrappers
around WSALookupService*() functions (see "Sample Code for a Service
Provider" on MSDN).

   On W32 GNUnet builds a libw32nsp - a namespace provider, which can
then be installed into the system by using w32nsp-install (and
uninstalled by w32nsp-uninstall), as described in "Installation
Handbook".

   libw32nsp is very simple and has almost no dependencies.  As a
response to NSPLookupServiceBegin(), it only checks that the provider
GUID passed to it by the caller matches GNUnet DNS Provider GUID, then
connects to gnunet-gns-helper-service-w32 at 127.0.0.1:5353 (hardcoded)
and sends the name resolution request there, returning the connected
socket to the caller.

   When the caller invokes NSPLookupServiceNext(), libw32nsp reads a
completely formed reply from that socket, unmarshalls it, then gives it
back to the caller.

   At the moment gnunet-gns-helper-service-w32 is implemented to ever
give only one reply, and subsequent calls to NSPLookupServiceNext() will
fail with WSA_NODATA (first call to NSPLookupServiceNext() might also
fail if GNS failed to find the name, or there was an error connecting to
it).

   gnunet-gns-helper-service-w32 does most of the processing:

   • Maintains a connection to GNS.
   • Reads GNS config and loads appropriate keys.
   • Checks service GUID and decides on the type of record to look up,
     refusing to make a lookup outright when unsupported service GUID is
     passed.
   • Launches the lookup

   When lookup result arrives, gnunet-gns-helper-service-w32 forms a
complete reply (including filling a WSAQUERYSETW structure and,
possibly, a binary blob with a hostent structure for gethostbyname()
client), marshalls it, and sends it back to libw32nsp.  If no records
were found, it sends an empty header.

   This works for most normal applications that use gethostbyname() or
getaddrinfo() to resolve names, but fails to do anything with
applications that use alternative means of resolving names (such as
sending queries to a DNS server directly by themselves).  This includes
some of well known utilities, like "ping" and "nslookup".


File: gnunet.info,  Node: GNS Namecache,  Next: REVOCATION Subsystem,  Prev: GNU Name System (GNS),  Up: GNUnet Developer Handbook

6.33 GNS Namecache
==================

The NAMECACHE subsystem is responsible for caching (encrypted)
resolution results of the GNU Name System (GNS). GNS makes zone
information available to other users via the DHT. However, as accessing
the DHT for every lookup is expensive (and as the DHT’s local cache is
lost whenever the peer is restarted), GNS uses the NAMECACHE as a more
persistent cache for DHT lookups.  Thus, instead of always looking up
every name in the DHT, GNS first checks if the result is already
available locally in the NAMECACHE. Only if there is no result in the
NAMECACHE, GNS queries the DHT. The NAMECACHE stores data in the same
(encrypted) format as the DHT. It thus makes no sense to iterate over
all items in the NAMECACHE — the NAMECACHE does not have a way to
provide the keys required to decrypt the entries.

   Blocks in the NAMECACHE share the same expiration mechanism as blocks
in the DHT — the block expires wheneever any of the records in the
(encrypted) block expires.  The expiration time of the block is the only
information stored in plaintext.  The NAMECACHE service internally
performs all of the required work to expire blocks, clients do not have
to worry about this.  Also, given that NAMECACHE stores only GNS blocks
that local users requested, there is no configuration option to limit
the size of the NAMECACHE. It is assumed to be always small enough (a
few MB) to fit on the drive.

   The NAMECACHE supports the use of different database backends via a
plugin API.

6.33.1 libgnunetnamecache
-------------------------

The NAMECACHE API consists of five simple functions.  First, there is
‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_connect’ to connect to the NAMECACHE service.  This
returns the handle required for all other operations on the NAMECACHE.
Using ‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_block_cache’ clients can insert a block into the
cache.  ‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_lookup_block’ can be used to lookup blocks
that were stored in the NAMECACHE. Both operations can be cancelled
using ‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_cancel’.  Note that cancelling a
‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_block_cache’ operation can result in the block being
stored in the NAMECACHE — or not.  Cancellation primarily ensures that
the continuation function with the result of the operation will no
longer be invoked.  Finally, ‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_disconnect’ closes the
connection to the NAMECACHE.

   The maximum size of a block that can be stored in the NAMECACHE is
‘GNUNET_NAMECACHE_MAX_VALUE_SIZE’, which is defined to be 63 kB.

6.33.2 The NAMECACHE Client-Service Protocol
--------------------------------------------

All messages in the NAMECACHE IPC protocol start with the ‘struct
GNUNET_NAMECACHE_Header’ which adds a request ID (32-bit integer) to the
standard message header.  The request ID is used to match requests with
the respective responses from the NAMECACHE, as they are allowed to
happen out-of-order.

6.33.2.1 Lookup
...............

The ‘struct LookupBlockMessage’ is used to lookup a block stored in the
cache.  It contains the query hash.  The NAMECACHE always responds with
a ‘struct LookupBlockResponseMessage’.  If the NAMECACHE has no
response, it sets the expiration time in the response to zero.
Otherwise, the response is expected to contain the expiration time, the
ECDSA signature, the derived key and the (variable-size) encrypted data
of the block.

6.33.2.2 Store
..............

The ‘struct BlockCacheMessage’ is used to cache a block in the
NAMECACHE. It has the same structure as the ‘struct
LookupBlockResponseMessage’.  The service responds with a ‘struct
BlockCacheResponseMessage’ which contains the result of the operation
(success or failure).  In the future, we might want to make it possible
to provide an error message as well.

6.33.3 The NAMECACHE Plugin API

store a block in the database, and ‘lookup_block’ to lookup a block in
the database.

6.33.3.1 Lookup2
................

The ‘lookup_block’ function is expected to return at most one block to
the iterator, and return ‘GNUNET_NO’ if there were no non-expired
results.  If there are multiple non-expired results in the cache, the
lookup is supposed to return the result with the largest expiration
time.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Store2,  Prev: Lookup2,  Up: The NAMECACHE Plugin API

6.33.3.2 Store2
...............

The ‘cache_block’ function is expected to try to store the block in the
database, and return ‘GNUNET_SYSERR’ if this was not possible for any
reason.  Furthermore, ‘cache_block’ is expected to implicitly perform
cache maintenance and purge blocks from the cache that have expired.
Note that ‘cache_block’ might encounter the case where the database
already has another block stored under the same key.  In this case, the
plugin must ensure that the block with the larger expiration time is
preserved.  Obviously, this can done either by simply adding new blocks
and selecting for the most recent expiration time during lookup, or by
checking which block is more recent during the store operation.

6.34 REVOCATION Subsystem
=========================

The REVOCATION subsystem is responsible for key revocation of Egos.  If
a user learns that theis private key has been compromised or has lost
it, they can use the REVOCATION system to inform all of the other users
that their private key is no longer valid.  The subsystem thus includes
ways to query for the validity of keys and to propagate revocation
messages.

File: gnunet.info,  Node: Dissemination,  Next: Revocation Message Design Requirements,  Up: REVOCATION Subsystem

6.34.1 Dissemination
--------------------

When a revocation is performed, the revocation is first of all
disseminated by flooding the overlay network.  The goal is to reach
every peer, so that when a peer needs to check if a key has been
revoked, this will be purely a local operation where the peer looks at
his local revocation list.  Flooding the network is also the most robust
form of key revocation — an adversary would have to control a separator
of the overlay graph to restrict the propagation of the revocation
message.  Flooding is also very easy to implement — peers that receive a
revocation message for a key that they have never seen before simply
pass the message to all of their neighbours.

   Flooding can only distribute the revocation message to peers that are
online.  In order to notify peers that join the network later, the
revocation service performs efficient set reconciliation over the sets
of known revocation messages whenever two peers (that both support
REVOCATION dissemination) connect.  The SET service is used to perform
this operation efficiently.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Revocation Message Design Requirements,  Next: libgnunetrevocation,  Prev: Dissemination,  Up: REVOCATION Subsystem

6.34.2 Revocation Message Design Requirements
---------------------------------------------

However, flooding is also quite costly, creating O(|E|) messages on a
network with |E| edges.  Thus, revocation messages are required to
contain a proof-of-work, the result of an expensive computation (which,
however, is cheap to verify).  Only peers that have expended the CPU
time necessary to provide this proof will be able to flood the network
with the revocation message.  This ensures that an attacker cannot
simply flood the network with millions of revocation messages.  The
proof-of-work required by GNUnet is set to take days on a typical PC to
compute; if the ability to quickly revoke a key is needed, users have
the option to pre-compute revocation messages to store off-line and use
instantly after their key has expired.

   Revocation messages must also be signed by the private key that is
being revoked.  Thus, they can only be created while the private key is
in the possession of the respective user.  This is another reason to
create a revocation message ahead of time and store it in a secure
location.

revocations.

6.34.3.1 Querying for revoked keys
..................................

‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_query’ is used to check if a given ECDSA public key
has been revoked.  The given callback will be invoked with the result of
the check.  The query can be cancelled using
‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_query_cancel’ on the return value.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: Preparing revocations,  Next: Issuing revocations,  Prev: Querying for revoked keys,  Up: libgnunetrevocation

6.34.3.2 Preparing revocations
..............................

It is often desirable to create a revocation record ahead-of-time and
store it in an off-line location to be used later in an emergency.  This
is particularly true for GNUnet revocations, where performing the
revocation operation itself is computationally expensive and thus is
likely to take some time.  Thus, if users want the ability to perform
revocations quickly in an emergency, they must pre-compute the
revocation message.  The revocation API enables this with two functions
that are used to compute the revocation message, but not trigger the
actual revocation operation.

   ‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_check_pow’ should be used to calculate the
proof-of-work required in the revocation message.  This function takes
the public key, the required number of bits for the proof of work (which
in GNUnet is a network-wide constant) and finally a proof-of-work number
as arguments.  The function then checks if the given proof-of-work
number is a valid proof of work for the given public key.  Clients
preparing a revocation are expected to call this function repeatedly
(typically with a monotonically increasing sequence of numbers of the
proof-of-work number) until a given number satisfies the check.  That
number should then be saved for later use in the revocation operation.

   ‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_sign_revocation’ is used to generate the signature
that is required in a revocation message.  It takes the private key that
(possibly in the future) is to be revoked and returns the signature.
The signature can again be saved to disk for later use, which will then
allow performing a revocation even without access to the private key.

6.34.3.3 Issuing revocations
............................

Given a ECDSA public key, the signature from ‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_sign’
and the proof-of-work, ‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_revoke’ can be used to perform
the actual revocation.  The given callback is called upon completion of
the operation.  ‘GNUNET_REVOCATION_revoke_cancel’ can be used to stop
the library from calling the continuation; however, in that case it is
undefined whether or not the revocation operation will be executed.

6.34.4 The REVOCATION Client-Service Protocol
---------------------------------------------

The REVOCATION protocol consists of four simple messages.

   A ‘QueryMessage’ containing a public ECDSA key is used to check if a
particular key has been revoked.  The service responds with a
‘QueryResponseMessage’ which simply contains a bit that says if the
given public key is still valid, or if it has been revoked.

   The second possible interaction is for a client to revoke a key by
passing a ‘RevokeMessage’ to the service.  The ‘RevokeMessage’ contains
the ECDSA public key to be revoked, a signature by the corresponding
private key and the proof-of-work, The service responds with a
‘RevocationResponseMessage’ which can be used to indicate that the
‘RevokeMessage’ was invalid (i.e.  proof of work incorrect), or
otherwise indicates that the revocation has been processed successfully.

6.34.5 The REVOCATION Peer-to-Peer Protocol
-------------------------------------------

Revocation uses two disjoint ways to spread revocation information among
peers.  First of all, P2P gossip exchanged via CORE-level neighbours is
used to quickly spread revocations to all connected peers.  Second,
whenever two peers (that both support revocations) connect, the SET
service is used to compute the union of the respective revocation sets.

   In both cases, the exchanged messages are ‘RevokeMessage’s which
contain the public key that is being revoked, a matching ECDSA
signature, and a proof-of-work.  Whenever a peer learns about a new
revocation this way, it first validates the signature and the
proof-of-work, then stores it to disk (typically to a file
$GNUNET_DATA_HOME/revocation.dat) and finally spreads the information to
all directly connected neighbours.

   For computing the union using the SET service, the peer with the
smaller hashed peer identity will connect (as a "client" in the
two-party set protocol) to the other peer after one second (to reduce
traffic spikes on connect) and initiate the computation of the set
union.  All revocation services use a common hash to identify the SET
operation over revocation sets.

   The current implementation accepts revocation set union operations
from all peers at any time; however, well-behaved peers should only
initiate this operation once after establishing a connection to a peer
with a larger hashed peer identity.

6.35 File-sharing (FS) Subsystem
================================

This chapter describes the details of how the file-sharing service
works.  As with all services, it is split into an API (libgnunetfs), the
service process (gnunet-service-fs) and user interface(s).  The
file-sharing service uses the datastore service to store blocks and the
DHT (and indirectly datacache) for lookups for non-anonymous
file-sharing.  Furthermore, the file-sharing service uses the block
library (and the block fs plugin) for validation of DHT operations.

   In contrast to many other services, libgnunetfs is rather complex
since the client library includes a large number of high-level
abstractions; this is necessary since the Fs service itself largely only
operates on the block level.  The FS library is responsible for
providing a file-based abstraction to applications, including
directories, meta data, keyword search, verification, and so on.

   The method used by GNUnet to break large files into blocks and to use
keyword search is called the "Encoding for Censorship Resistant Sharing"
(ECRS). ECRS is largely implemented in the fs library; block validation
is also reflected in the block FS plugin and the FS service.  ECRS
on-demand encoding is implemented in the FS service.

   NOTE: The documentation in this chapter is quite incomplete.

6.35.1 Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing (ECRS)
-------------------------------------------------------

When GNUnet shares files, it uses a content encoding that is called
ECRS, the Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing.  Most of ECRS is
described in the (so far unpublished) research paper attached to this
page.  ECRS obsoletes the previous ESED and ESED II encodings which were
used in GNUnet before version 0.7.0.  The rest of this page assumes that
the reader is familiar with the attached paper.  What follows is a
description of some minor extensions that GNUnet makes over what is
described in the paper.  The reason why these extensions are not in the
paper is that we felt that they were obvious or trivial extensions to
the original scheme and thus did not warrant space in the research
report.

File: gnunet.info,  Node: Namespace Advertisements,  Next: KSBlocks,  Up: Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing (ECRS)

6.35.1.1 Namespace Advertisements
.................................

An ‘SBlock’ with identifier all zeros is a signed advertisement for a
namespace.  This special ‘SBlock’ contains metadata describing the
content of the namespace.  Instead of the name of the identifier for a
potential update, it contains the identifier for the root of the
namespace.  The URI should always be empty.  The ‘SBlock’ is signed with
the content provder’s RSA private key (just like any other SBlock).
Peers can search for ‘SBlock’s in order to find out more about a
namespace.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: KSBlocks,  Prev: Namespace Advertisements,  Up: Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing (ECRS)

6.35.1.2 KSBlocks
.................

GNUnet implements ‘KSBlocks’ which are ‘KBlocks’ that, instead of
encrypting a CHK and metadata, encrypt an ‘SBlock’ instead.  In other
words, ‘KSBlocks’ enable GNUnet to find ‘SBlocks’ using the global
keyword search.  Usually the encrypted ‘SBlock’ is a namespace
advertisement.  The rationale behind ‘KSBlock’s and ‘SBlock’s is to
enable peers to discover namespaces via keyword searches, and, to
associate useful information with namespaces.  When GNUnet finds
‘KSBlocks’ during a normal keyword search, it adds the information to an
internal list of discovered namespaces.  Users looking for interesting
namespaces can then inspect this list, reducing the need for out-of-band
discovery of namespaces.  Naturally, namespaces (or more specifically,
namespace advertisements) can also be referenced from directories, but
‘KSBlock’s should make it easier to advertise namespaces for the owner
of the pseudonym since they eliminate the need to first create a
directory.

   Collections are also advertised using ‘KSBlock’s.

6.35.2 File-sharing persistence directory structure
---------------------------------------------------

This section documents how the file-sharing library implements
persistence of file-sharing operations and specifically the resulting
directory structure.  This code is only active if the
‘GNUNET_FS_FLAGS_PERSISTENCE’ flag was set when calling
‘GNUNET_FS_start’.  In this case, the file-sharing library will try hard
to ensure that all major operations (searching, downloading, publishing,
unindexing) are persistent, that is, can live longer than the process
itself.  More specifically, an operation is supposed to live until it is
explicitly stopped.

   If ‘GNUNET_FS_stop’ is called before an operation has been stopped, a
‘SUSPEND’ event is generated and then when the process calls
‘GNUNET_FS_start’ next time, a ‘RESUME’ event is generated.
Additionally, even if an application crashes (segfault, SIGKILL, system
crash) and hence ‘GNUNET_FS_stop’ is never called and no ‘SUSPEND’
events are generated, operations are still resumed (with ‘RESUME’
events).  This is implemented by constantly writing the current state of
the file-sharing operations to disk.  Specifically, the current state is
always written to disk whenever anything significant changes (the
exception are block-wise progress in publishing and unindexing, since
those operations would be slowed down significantly and can be resumed
cheaply even without detailed accounting).  Note that if the process
crashes (or is killed) during a serialization operation, FS does not
guarantee that this specific operation is recoverable (no strict
transactional semantics, again for performance reasons).  However, all
other unrelated operations should resume nicely.

   Since we need to serialize the state continuously and want to recover
as much as possible even after crashing during a serialization
operation, we do not use one large file for serialization.  Instead,
several directories are used for the various operations.  When
‘GNUNET_FS_start’ executes, the master directories are scanned for files
describing operations to resume.  Sometimes, these operations can refer
to related operations in child directories which may also be resumed at
this point.  Note that corrupted files are cleaned up automatically.
However, dangling files in child directories (those that are not
referenced by files from the master directories) are not automatically
removed.

   Persistence data is kept in a directory that begins with the
"STATE_DIR" prefix from the configuration file (by default,
"$SERVICEHOME/persistence/") followed by the name of the client as given
to ‘GNUNET_FS_start’ (for example, "gnunet-gtk") followed by the actual
name of the master or child directory.

   The names for the master directories follow the names of the
operations:

   • "search"
   • "download"
   • "publish"
   • "unindex"

   Each of the master directories contains names (chosen at random) for
each active top-level (master) operation.  Note that a download that is
associated with a search result is not a top-level operation.

   In contrast to the master directories, the child directories are only
consulted when another operation refers to them.  For each search, a
subdirectory (named after the master search synchronization file)
contains the search results.  Search results can have an associated
download, which is then stored in the general "download-child"
directory.  Downloads can be recursive, in which case children are
stored in subdirectories mirroring the structure of the recursive
download (either starting in the master "download" directory or in the
"download-child" directory depending on how the download was initiated).
For publishing operations, the "publish-file" directory contains
information about the individual files and directories that are part of
the publication.  However, this directory structure is flat and does not
mirror the structure of the publishing operation.  Note that unindex
operations cannot have associated child operations.

6.36 REGEX Subsystem
====================

Using the REGEX subsystem, you can discover peers that offer a
particular service using regular expressions.  The peers that offer a
service specify it using a regular expressions.  Peers that want to
patronize a service search using a string.  The REGEX subsystem will
then use the DHT to return a set of matching offerers to the patrons.

   For the technical details, we have Max’s defense talk and Max’s
Master’s thesis.

* How to run the regex profiler::


File: gnunet.info,  Node: How to run the regex profiler,  Up: REGEX Subsystem

6.36.1 How to run the regex profiler
------------------------------------

The gnunet-regex-profiler can be used to profile the usage of mesh/regex
for a given set of regular expressions and strings.  Mesh/regex allows
you to announce your peer ID under a certain regex and search for peers
matching a particular regex using a string.  See szengel2012ms
(https://gnunet.org/szengel2012ms) for a full introduction.

   First of all, the regex profiler uses GNUnet testbed, thus all the
implications for testbed also apply to the regex profiler (for example
you need password-less ssh login to the machines listed in your hosts
file).

   *Configuration*

   Moreover, an appropriate configuration file is needed.  Generally you
can refer to the ‘contrib/regex_profiler_infiniband.conf’ file in the
sourcecode of GNUnet for an example configuration.  In the following
paragraph the important details are highlighted.

   Announcing of the regular expressions is done by the
gnunet-daemon-regexprofiler, therefore you have to make sure it is
started, by adding it to the AUTOSTART set of ARM:

     [regexprofiler]
     AUTOSTART = YES

Furthermore you have to specify the location of the binary:

     [regexprofiler]
     # Location of the gnunet-daemon-regexprofiler binary.
     BINARY = /home/szengel/gnunet/src/mesh/.libs/gnunet-daemon-regexprofiler
     # Regex prefix that will be applied to all regular expressions and
     # search string.
     REGEX_PREFIX = "GNVPN-0001-PAD"

When running the profiler with a large scale deployment, you probably
want to reduce the workload of each peer.  Use the following options to
do this.

     [dht]
     # Force network size estimation
     FORCE_NSE = 1

     [dhtcache]
     DATABASE = heap
     # Disable RC-file for Bloom filter? (for benchmarking with limited IO
     # availability)
     DISABLE_BF_RC = YES
     # Disable Bloom filter entirely
     DISABLE_BF = YES

     [nse]
     # Minimize proof-of-work CPU consumption by NSE
     WORKBITS = 1

*Options*

   To finally run the profiler some options and the input data need to
be specified on the command line.

     gnunet-regex-profiler -c config-file -d log-file -n num-links \
     -p path-compression-length -s search-delay -t matching-timeout \
     -a num-search-strings hosts-file policy-dir search-strings-file

Where...

   • ...  ‘config-file’ means the configuration file created earlier.
   • ...  ‘log-file’ is the file where to write statistics output.
   • ...  ‘num-links’ indicates the number of random links between
     started peers.
   • ...  ‘path-compression-length’ is the maximum path compression
     length in the DFA.
   • ...  ‘search-delay’ time to wait between peers finished linking and
     starting to match strings.
   • ...  ‘matching-timeout’ timeout after which to cancel the
     searching.
   • ...  ‘num-search-strings’ number of strings in the
     search-strings-file.
   • ...  the ‘hosts-file’ should contain a list of hosts for the
     testbed, one per line in the following format:

        • ‘user@host_ip:port’
   • ...  the ‘policy-dir’ is a folder containing text files containing
     one or more regular expressions.  A peer is started for each file
     in that folder and the regular expressions in the corresponding
     file are announced by this peer.
   • ...  the ‘search-strings-file’ is a text file containing search
     strings, one in each line.

You can create regular expressions and search strings for every AS in
the Internet using the attached scripts.  You need one of the CAIDA
routeviews prefix2as
(http://data.caida.org/datasets/routing/routeviews-prefix2as/) data
files for this.  Run

     create_regex.py <filename> <output path>

to create the regular expressions and

     create_strings.py <input path> <outfile>

to create a search strings file from the previously created regular
expressions.


File: gnunet.info,  Node: REST Subsystem,  Prev: REGEX Subsystem,  Up: GNUnet Developer Handbook

6.37 REST Subsystem
===================

Using the REST subsystem, you can expose REST-based APIs or services.
The REST service is designed as a pluggable architecture.  To create a
new REST endpoint, simply add a library in the form “plugin_rest_*”.
The REST service will automatically load all REST plugins on startup.

   *Configuration*

   The REST service can be configured in various ways.  The reference
config file can be found in ‘src/rest/rest.conf’:
     [rest]
     REST_PORT=7776
     REST_ALLOW_HEADERS=Authorization,Accept,Content-Type
     REST_ALLOW_ORIGIN=*
     REST_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true

   The port as well as
 -- cross-origin resource sharing: (CORS)
   headers that are supposed to be advertised by the rest service are
configurable.

6.37.1 Namespace considerations
-------------------------------

The ‘gnunet-rest-service’ will load all plugins that are installed.  As
such it is important that the endpoint namespaces do not clash.

   For example, plugin X might expose the endpoint “/xxx” while plugin Y
exposes endpoint “/xxx/yyy”.  This is a problem if plugin X is also
supposed to handle a call to “/xxx/yyy”.  Currently the REST service
will not complain or warn about such clashes, so please make sure that
endpoints are unambiguous.

This is WIP. Endpoints should be documented appropriately.  Perferably
using annotations.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

Appendix B GNU General Public License
*************************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified
     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
     restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor
     version”.

     A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, “control”
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To “grant”
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
